## Three observable trends in this data:

1) Cheaper items are not necessarily more popular among purchasers. For example, the most purchased item "Final Critic" was within the top 20 most expense items, but was purchased the most.
2) Although there are many more Male than Female purchasers, Females still spend a proportionate amount of money. Approximately 14% of purchasers are Female, and they spend about 15% of the total purchases.
3) All but one of the top 5 purchasers were Male and in the 20-25 age group, except for one who was female, and one who was 15-20 (uncorrelated).
